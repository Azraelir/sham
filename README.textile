h1. Sham Plugin

Because SEO is a sham and you know it

h2. Background

I needed something to manage all my SEO-related needs for CakePackages, and while there were some community plugins that took care of certain things, they were either lacking or did way too much. So I built this.

SEO isn't really a sham, I just couldn't think of a name that wouldn't conflict with the @Seo@ model for the component.

h2. Requirements

* PHP 5.2.6+
* CakePHP 1.3

h2. Installation

_[Manual]_

# Download this: http://github.com/josegonzalez/sham/zipball/master
# Unzip that download.
# Copy the resulting folder to app/plugins
# Rename the folder you just copied to @sham@

_[GIT Submodule]_

In your app directory type:
<pre><code>git submodule add git://github.com/josegonzalez/sham.git plugins/sham
git submodule init
git submodule update
</code></pre>

_[GIT Clone]_

In your plugin directory type
<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/josegonzalez/sham.git sham</code></pre>
