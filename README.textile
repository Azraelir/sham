h1. Sham Plugin

Because SEO is a sham and you know it

h2. Background

I needed something to manage all my SEO-related needs for CakePackages, and while there were some community plugins that took care of certain things, they were either lacking or did way too much. So I built this.

SEO isn't really a sham, I just couldn't think of a name that wouldn't conflict with the @Seo@ model for the component.

h2. Requirements

* PHP 5.2.6+
* CakePHP 1.3

h2. Installation

_[Manual]_

# Download this: http://github.com/josegonzalez/sham/zipball/master
# Unzip that download.
# Copy the resulting folder to app/plugins
# Rename the folder you just copied to @sham@

_[GIT Submodule]_

In your app directory type:
<pre><code>git submodule add git://github.com/josegonzalez/sham.git plugins/sham
git submodule init
git submodule update
</code></pre>

_[GIT Clone]_

In your plugin directory type
<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/josegonzalez/sham.git sham</code></pre>

h2. Usage

Add the component to your AppController $components and $helpers arrays:

<pre><code>
public $components = array('Sham.Sham');

public $helpers = array('Sham.Sham');
</code></pre>

Create the callbacks for setting default metadata in your AppController:

<pre><code>
	public function _seoFallback() {
		// ... code ...
	}
</pre></code>

To each controller, add a callback to set SEO for each view:

<pre><code>
class UsersController extends AppController {

	public function _seoIndex() {
		$this->Sham->loadBySlug('users');
		$this->Sham->setMeta('title', 'CakePHP Plugin and Application Search | CakePackages');
		// set more variables
	}
